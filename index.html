        <h2>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h2>
        <p>Dear Eileen,<br><br>
        Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part<br>
        of your <abbr title="doctor of philosophy">PhD</abbr> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>
        <h3>Starting dates</h3>
        <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if <br>
            you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>First semester:<time datetime="2016-09-09"> 9 September 2016</time></li>
                <li>Second semester:<time datetime="2017-01-15"></time> 15 January 2017</li>
                <li>Third semester:<time datetime="2017-05-02">2 May 2017</time> </li>
            </ul>
            Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.<br><br>
            You can find more information about <a href="http://example.com">important university dates</a> on our website.
        </p>
        <h3>Subjects of study</h3>
        <p>
            At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall <br>
            somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just <br>
            the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued <br>
            by are as follows, in order of priority:
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
                <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30&deg;C (86&deg;F), when the <br>
                    audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
                <li><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
            </ol>
            So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the <br>
            research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
        </p>
        <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>
        <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, <br>
            my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:<br></p>
            <section class="dance">
                <p><div>Polynesian chicken dance</div>
                <div class="dance-descript">A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300<abbr title="Before Christ">BC</abbr>, a whole village would dance around <br>
                    in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".
                </div>
                <div>Icelandic brownian shuffle</div>
                <div class="dance-descript"> Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which <br>
                    involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly <br>
                    tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired <br>
                    modern styles such as Twerking.
                </div>
                <div>Arctic robot dance</div>
                <div class="dance-descript">An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have <br>
                    discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants <br>
                    of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this <br>
                    because they were really cold.
